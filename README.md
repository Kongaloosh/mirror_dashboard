*What the heckbiscuit is this?* It's a small web-app designed to make a heads-up-display that shows you what's going on

* Open Weather


Note, there are a number of ways to use Open Weather. To get the most accurate weather report, it's best to use
a location ID. This can be found at [Open Weather's site](http://bulk.openweathermap.org/sample/).
